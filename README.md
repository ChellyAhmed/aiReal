# AI vs Real Image Classification ü§ñüì∏

A deep learning project that classifies images as either AI-generated (fake) or real using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project uses the CIFAKE dataset to train a binary classifier capable of distinguishing between authentic and synthetic images.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project addresses the growing challenge of distinguishing between real and AI-generated images. With the advancement of generative AI models, it has become increasingly difficult to identify synthetic content with the naked eye. This CNN-based classifier provides an automated solution to detect AI-generated images.

### Key Objectives

- Build a robust binary classifier for AI vs real image detection
- Analyze file size patterns between real and synthetic images
- Implement proper data preprocessing and model evaluation techniques
- Achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between authentic and generated content

## üìä Dataset

The project uses the **CIFAKE** dataset, which contains:

- **Training Set**:
  - Real images: `/train/REAL/`
  - Fake (AI-generated) images: `/train/FAKE/`
- **Test Set**:
  - Real images: `/test/REAL/`
  - Fake (AI-generated) images: `/test/FAKE/`

### Dataset Characteristics

- **Image Format**: 32x32 pixel RGB images in JPEG format
- **Preprocessing**: Images are normalized to [0,1] range
- **Labels**: Binary classification (0 = Fake, 1 = Real)
